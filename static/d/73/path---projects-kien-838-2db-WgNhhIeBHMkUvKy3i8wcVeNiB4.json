Finally, I asked how the app could be of added value for them.</p>\n<p>While testing the Kien app, users were asked to look up and interpret information about the speakers in the Kien app. Users were also asked to change speaker settings. Through observation and taking notes of their experience, I got a sense of which challenges the users faced.</p>\n<p>I also analyzed comparable apps (e. g. Bose and Sonos) to find out how they provided overview of multiple speakers. </p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/3eaae/2.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 87.37704918032786%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Sonos\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/893a4/2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/bbf57/2.jpg 200w,\n/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/260b8/2.jpg 400w,\n/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/893a4/2.jpg 800w,\n/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/25965/2.jpg 1200w,\n/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/e54c8/2.jpg 1600w,\n/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/3eaae/2.jpg 1830w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Understand the user</h2>\n<p><strong>The interviews showed that users wanted the app to be a control panel, so they can manage their speakers fully through the app. Usabilitytests showed that users experienced the app as too technical and that many unique features were hard to find.</strong></p>\n<p>The interviews and usability tests showed that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The current app mainly focuses on the underlying technology.</li>\n<li>The app provides unclear information about the composition of the groups.

After multiple iterations of usertests and refinement, the app provided a simple non-technical overview, clear information about the groups and controle over the speakers.</strong></p>\n<p>First I started sketching and making wireframes based on the results of the analysis of the interviews and tests. Because users thought the speakers were interactive, I concluded that, by tapping on the speaker, it should be possible for users to turn the speaker on/off or change it’s settings. In addition, I was inspired by the way you can drag and drop apps on your iPhone. Implementing this in the Kien dashboard, made it possible for users to add or remove speakers from groups by ‘drag-and-drop’ them from one group to the other (as shown in the wireframe below). User could change the groupsettings by tapping on the setting symbol top right.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/6e1ad6b925e3db7f092109a0f9d3df15/ba742/4.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 92.09833187006146%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Wireframes\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/6e1ad6b925e3db7f092109a0f9d3df15/893a4/4.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6e1ad6b925e3db7f092109a0f9d3df15/bbf57/4.jpg 200w,\n/static/6e1ad6b925e3db7f092109a0f9d3df15/260b8/4.jpg 400w,\n/static/6e1ad6b925e3db7f092109a0f9d3df15/893a4/4.jpg 800w,\n/static/6e1ad6b925e3db7f092109a0f9d3df15/25965/4.jpg 1200w,\n/static/6e1ad6b925e3db7f092109a0f9d3df15/e54c8/4.jpg 1600w,\n/static/6e1ad6b925e3db7f092109a0f9d3df15/7c0ed/4.jpg 2400w,\n/static/6e1ad6b925e3db7f092109a0f9d3df15/ba742/4.jpg 3417w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>During five usertests, it was found that this wasn’t the perfect set-up for users, because the design needed too much explanation. Although it was clear for users how to turn speakers on or off, users didn’t easily understand the drag and drop feature. In addition, important settings were still hidden and it was unclear for users how to create new groups.</p>\n<p>I used the feedback obtained from the usertests and analyzed how I might solve these problems they were facing. With adjustments and iterations I refined the user experience design of the Kien app and added a visual design matching the technical feel of the speakers. It resulted in the following solutions.</p>\n<h4>Dashboard and clear navigation</h4>\n<p>It was difficult for users to see which groups existed, so I chose to create a dashboard in which the user first could see an overview of the different groups. From this dashboard the user can go to the desired group with one click. From here the status of the speakers, the composition of the groups and several unique group settings are viewed and can be adjusted. I have omitted or simplified information that caused confusion by prioritizing important information and putting important or fun features in the foreground.
