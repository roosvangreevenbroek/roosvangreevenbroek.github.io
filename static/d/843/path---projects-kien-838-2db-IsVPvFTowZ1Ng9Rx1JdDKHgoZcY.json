{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>The problem</h2>\n<p><strong>Because the Kien speakers are so flexible, users lose track of which speakers form groups and which speakers are on or off. The current app gives little or no insight about this.</strong></p>\n<p>When a user has several Kien speakers at home, the speaker can be connected to a group by tapping the speakers together and also be disconnected this way. The speakers can be put anywhere, as long as they are connected to your phone via bluetooh. Unfortunately, users seem to lose sight of the overall picture. This is due to the following problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changes in groupformation of speakers are reflected in the Kien app but users do not seem to understand the current interface of the App.</li>\n<li>The speakers physically do not show which ones form groups. All speakers look the same. Because of this, and the current interface of the app, users quickly lose track of group formation with or without the App.</li>\n<li>Users lose track of the status (on/off) of the speakers. The App doesnâ€™t provide information about this, and users find it difficult to check this on the speakers when they are scattered around the house.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"September 01, 2018","path":"/projects/kien","title":"A redesign of the Kien app made it possible to have more overview and control over the flexible Kien speakers","supertitle":"Redesign Kien app","intro":"Kien is a sound system that can adapt to every situation.
