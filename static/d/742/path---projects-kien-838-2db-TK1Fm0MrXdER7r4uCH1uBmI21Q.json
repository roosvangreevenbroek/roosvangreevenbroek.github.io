{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>The problem</h2>\n<p><strong>Because the Kien speakers are so flexible, users lose track of which speakers form groups and which speakers are on or off. The current app gives little or no insight about this.</strong></p>\n<p>When a user has several Kien speakers at home, the speaker can be connected to a group by tapping the speakers together and also be disconnected this way. The speakers can be put anywhere, as long as they are connected to your phone via bluetooh. Unfortunately, users seem to lose sight of the overall picture. This is due to the following problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changes in groupformation of speakers are reflected in the Kien app but users do not seem to understand the current interface of the App.</li>\n<li>The speakers physically do not show which ones form groups. All speakers look the same. Because of this, and the current interface of the app, users quickly lose track of group formation with or without the App.</li>\n<li>Users lose track of the status (on/off) of the speakers. The App doesn’t provide information about this, and users find it difficult to check this on the speakers when they are scattered around the house.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/17fabb8361fa81c45285cfcca3f56393/1d37d/1.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 68.75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Kien\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/17fabb8361fa81c45285cfcca3f56393/893a4/1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/17fabb8361fa81c45285cfcca3f56393/bbf57/1.jpg 200w,\n/static/17fabb8361fa81c45285cfcca3f56393/260b8/1.jpg 400w,\n/static/17fabb8361fa81c45285cfcca3f56393/893a4/1.jpg 800w,\n/static/17fabb8361fa81c45285cfcca3f56393/25965/1.jpg 1200w,\n/static/17fabb8361fa81c45285cfcca3f56393/e54c8/1.jpg 1600w,\n/static/17fabb8361fa81c45285cfcca3f56393/1d37d/1.jpg 1920w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The challenge</h2>\n<p><strong>A redesign of the Kien app to provide a better overview of the formation of groups and status of the speakers. Also creating an additional design element to the speakers to identify them physically but also in the app.</strong></p>\n<p>After after a redesign of the app there still would be a problem. Even with the app, users won’t be able to tell physically which speaker formed a group or was on/off because all the speakers looked the same. I concluded that an additional physical design element had to be added to the speakers in order to distinguish the speakers from eachother and provide a useful overview.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Method</h2>\n<p><strong>To research the paintpoints of users and oppertunities for improvent of the Kien app, I conducted five interviews and usabilitytests and conducted C &#x26; C research.</strong></p>\n<p>During the interviews, I asked users how they use their speakers and in which situations they wanted to use it. I also asked them what they expected from the Kien app and what they experienced as good or bad features. Finally, I asked how the app could be of added value for them.</p>\n<p>While testing the Kien app, users were asked to look up and interpret information about the speakers in the Kien app. Users were also asked to change speaker settings. Through observation and taking notes of their experience, I got a sense of which challenges the users faced.</p>\n<p>I also analyzed comparable apps (e. g. Bose and Sonos) to find out how they provided overview of multiple speakers. </p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/3eaae/2.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 87.37704918032786%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAARABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQABAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAQIF/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB7W2a5YRiSuEgP//EABoQAAMAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAxASITL/2gAIAQEAAQUC7tmtkkTdaqVJ+P/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQMBAT8BH//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQIBAT8BH//EABsQAAEEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAEBESAiAh/9oACAEBAAY/Ao0FzEq2HQwb/8QAHBAAAwABBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERQSAhMWGh/9oACAEBAAE/IW/RkaTlEpwUZ9c2Kmw3QX//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEHDHPP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQMBAT8QH//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQIBAT8QH//EABsQAQEBAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAERADEhcWHB/9oACAEBAAE/EEyQpHkSzvLkBdeRTAZU/XEUi6sXs+zZ3n3HqRQhPTvc7++5fXf/2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Sonos\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/893a4/2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/bbf57/2.jpg 200w,\n/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/260b8/2.jpg 400w,\n/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/893a4/2.jpg 800w,\n/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/25965/2.jpg 1200w,\n/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/e54c8/2.jpg 1600w,\n/static/143049b4c6b3d3f5a90466a6297f7ad3/3eaae/2.jpg 1830w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Understand the user</h2>\n<p><strong>The interviews showed that users wanted the app to be a control panel, so they can manage their speakers fully through the app. Usabilitytests showed that users experienced the app as too technical and that many unique features were hard to find.</strong></p>\n<p>The interviews and usability tests showed that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The current app mainly focuses on the underlying technology.</li>\n<li>The app provides unclear information about the composition of the groups.
